# Evidence For

<Metabolic Switch Mechanism>

(1) [Metabolic Switch]: De Cabo & Mattson 2019 report that fasting
    triggers a shift from glucose to ketone metabolism with increased
    longevity in animal models. #observation
    [De Cabo & Mattson 2019](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1905136)
    > "Evidence is accumulating that eating in a 6-hour period and fasting for 18 hours can trigger a metabolic switch from glucose-based to ketone-based energy, with increased stress resistance, increased longevity, and a decreased incidence of diseases"
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "NEJM review, highly cited, but summarizes animal and observational evidence"}
(2) [Stress Pathways]: Mattson et al. 2017 find IF activates
    stress-response pathways including BDNF and autophagy. #observation
    [Mattson et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611299114)
    > "Intermittent metabolic switching, repeating cycles of a metabolic challenge that activates stress response signaling pathways, and a recovery period with rest and food intake, may optimize brain function and resilience"
    {credence: 0.70, reason: "PNAS paper, plausible mechanism, but animal model data"}
(3) [Cellular Maintenance]: Longo & Panda 2016 argue fasting triggers
    cellular maintenance pathways that could delay aging. #observation
    [Longo & Panda 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.005)
    > "Fasting has the potential to delay aging and help prevent and treat diseases while minimizing the side effects caused by chronic dietary interventions"
    {credence: 0.65, reason: "Cell Metabolism review, but 'potential' language is hedged"}
--
Multiple plausible mechanisms connect IF to longevity-related pathways
{uses: [1, 2, 3]}
--
(4) [Mechanism Exists]: IF activates known longevity-associated biological
    pathways in animal models.
    {inference: 0.70, reason: "mechanisms are real but mostly demonstrated in animals"}
  +> [IF Extends Lifespan]

<Biomarker Improvement>

(1) [ADF Biomarkers]: Stekovic et al. 2019 show alternate-day fasting
    improved cardiovascular markers and reduced fat mass in a 4-week
    RCT of 60 healthy adults. #observation
    [Stekovic et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.09.007)
    > "Strict ADF for more than 6 months improved markers of general health in healthy, middle-aged humans while adverse effects did not occur even after >6 months"
    {credence: 0.75, reason: "RCT but small sample, short duration, surrogate endpoints"}
(2) [Biomarker Assumption]: Improved cardiovascular and metabolic
    biomarkers predict longer lifespan. #assumption
    {credence: 0.50, reason: "biomarker-outcome link is uncertain; surrogate endpoints often fail"}
--
Surrogate markers improved by IF may indicate lifespan benefit
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Human Biomarker Signal]: IF improves biomarkers associated with
    longevity in short-term human trials.
    {inference: 0.45, reason: "surrogate endpoints, small trial, short duration"}
  +> [IF Extends Lifespan]

# Evidence Against

<Inconsistent Animal Results>

(1) [ITP Inconsistent]: The NIA Interventions Testing Program finds IF
    protocols show inconsistent lifespan extension across genetically
    heterogeneous mice. #observation
    [NIA ITP](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dab/interventions-testing-program-itp)
    > "Caloric restriction remains the gold standard; intermittent fasting protocols tested have shown inconsistent lifespan extension in genetically heterogeneous mice"
    {credence: 0.82, reason: "ITP is gold-standard multi-site program for lifespan testing"}
(2) [Circadian Dependency]: Pak et al. 2021 show IF lifespan extension
    in Drosophila requires intact circadian clock genes. #observation
    [Pak et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-021-00127-4)
    > "Time-restricted feeding promotes longevity through circadian clock-mediated improvement of gut homeostasis"
    {credence: 0.70, reason: "Nature Aging paper, but Drosophila model"}
--
IF lifespan effects are genotype-dependent and inconsistent across models
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Animal Evidence Weak]: Animal evidence for IF lifespan extension
    is inconsistent and genotype-dependent.
    {inference: 0.75, reason: "ITP is the strongest lifespan evidence and it is negative"}
  -> [IF Extends Lifespan]

<Translation Gap>

(1) [Translation Problem]: A 2023 Cell review notes that translating
    lifespan findings from model organisms to humans remains a central
    challenge. #observation
    [Cell 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035)
    > "Translation of findings from short-lived model organisms to humans remains a central challenge in aging research"
    {credence: 0.88, reason: "Cell review, well-established problem in aging research"}
(2) [No Human Lifespan Data]: No RCT has measured actual human lifespan
    as an endpoint for IF. #assumption
    {credence: 0.95, reason: "such a trial would take decades; none exists"}
--
Even positive animal results may not translate to human lifespan
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [No Direct Evidence]: There is no direct evidence that IF extends
    human lifespan.
    {inference: 0.90, reason: "absence of evidence is strong given translation gap"}
  -> [IF Extends Lifespan]

<Adherence Problem>

(1) [High Dropout]: Lowe et al. 2020 report dropout rates of 20-40%
    in IF trials. #observation
    [Lowe et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3049)
    > "dropout rates in intermittent fasting trials range from 20% to 40%, comparable to other dietary interventions"
    {credence: 0.78, reason: "JAMA Internal Medicine RCT, found no weight loss benefit either"}
(2) [Adherence Required]: A lifespan intervention must be sustained
    for decades to plausibly affect longevity. #assumption
    {credence: 0.85, reason: "biological aging is slow; brief interventions unlikely to shift lifespan"}
--
Poor adherence undermines real-world lifespan benefit even if IF works biologically
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Practical Barrier]: Real-world adherence problems make sustained
    IF unlikely to deliver lifespan benefits at population scale.
    {inference: 0.60, reason: "adherence is bad but comparable to other diets, not unique to IF"}
  -> [IF Extends Lifespan]
