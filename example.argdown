// Top-level claim: credence is computed from the arguments below
[Reliable]: Linear probes are a reliable method for evaluating
  neural network representations.
  + <Linear Separability>
  - <Probe Overfitting>

# Evidence For

<Linear Separability>

(1) [Monotonic]: Alain & Bengio 2016 train linear classifier probes
    on intermediate layers of Inception v3 and ResNet-50. #observation
    [Alain & Bengio 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01644)
    > "we observe experimentally that the linear separability of features increase monotonically along the depth of the model"
    {reason: "4000+ citations, replicated across architectures", credence: 0.92}
(2) [Linearity Assumption]: If a property is linearly separable in
    a representation, it is likely encoded explicitly rather than
    requiring nonlinear computation to extract. #assumption
    {reason: "plausible but nonlinear features exist too", credence: 0.65}
--
Monotonic separability suggests probes track genuine feature quality
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Probes Valid]: Linear probes reveal genuine structure in
    neural network representations.
    {inference: 0.92, reason: "direct implication if both premises hold"}
  +> [Reliable]

# Evidence Against

<Probe Overfitting>

(1) [Control Tasks]: Hewitt & Liang 2019 propose control tasks
    to test probe selectivity on ELMo representations. #observation
    [Hewitt & Liang 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03368)
    > "popular probes on ELMo representations are not selective"
    {reason: "well-designed experiment, widely cited", credence: 0.90}
(2) [Limitations Survey]: Belinkov 2022 reviews the probing
    classifiers methodology. #observation
    [Belinkov 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452)
    > "recent studies have demonstrated various methodological limitations of this approach"
    {reason: "comprehensive survey but some claims are speculative", credence: 0.88}
--
High accuracy alone is insufficient evidence of encoding
{uses: [1, 2]}
--
(3) [Probes Mislead]: High probe accuracy may not reliably indicate
    that a representation genuinely encodes a property.
    {inference: 0.51, reason: "shows problems exist but doesn't prove probes are useless"}
