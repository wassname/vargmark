<Recursive Takeoff>
(1) [No Ceiling]: No fundamental barrier at human level. #assumption
    {reason: "no known theoretical ceiling", credence: 0.85}
(2) [Self Improve]: Capable AI could improve its own training. #assumption
    {reason: "speculative but plausible", credence: 0.50}
----
(3) [Rapid Gain]: Recursive self-improvement produces rapid capability gain.
    {reason: "possible but not certain", inference: 0.40}
(4) [Narrow Window]: Intervention window may be very short. #assumption
    {reason: "depends on speed of recursive improvement", credence: 0.35}
----
(5) [Pause Buys Time]: A pause gives safety margin before recursive takeoff.
    {reason: "only helps if takeoff is near", inference: 0.30}
