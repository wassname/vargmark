[Fusion By 2045]: Commercial fusion energy available by 2045.
  + <Fusion If ITER Succeeds>

// Contradiction: exactly one scenario
[ITER Succeeds]: ITER achieves Q>10 by 2035. #assumption
  {reason: "behind schedule but possible", credence: 0.40}
  - [ITER Fails]
[ITER Fails]: ITER does not achieve Q>10. #assumption
  {reason: "history of delays", credence: 0.60}
  - [ITER Succeeds]

<Fusion If ITER Succeeds>

(1) [ITER Succeeds]
(2) [Fast Commercialization]: Private sector scales quickly after proof. #assumption
    {reason: "assumes regulatory cooperation", credence: 0.50}
----
(3) [Commercial Fusion Possible]: Commercial fusion reactors by 2045.
