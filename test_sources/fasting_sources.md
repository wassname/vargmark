# Source Materials: Does Intermittent Fasting Extend Lifespan?

## Source 1: De Cabo & Mattson 2019 (NEJM Review)

Quote: "Evidence is accumulating that eating in a 6-hour period and fasting for 18 hours can trigger a metabolic switch from glucose-based to ketone-based energy, with increased stress resistance, increased longevity, and a decreased incidence of diseases"
Finding: Comprehensive review of IF mechanisms and health benefits in NEJM.

## Source 2: Longo & Panda 2016 (Cell Metabolism)
URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.005
Quote: "Fasting has the potential to delay aging and help prevent and treat diseases while minimizing the side effects caused by chronic dietary interventions"
Finding: Review arguing fasting triggers cellular maintenance pathways.

## Source 3: Stekovic et al. 2019 (Cell Metabolism, RCT)
URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.09.007
Quote: "Strict ADF for more than 6 months improved markers of general health in healthy, middle-aged humans while adverse effects did not occur even after >6 months"
Finding: 4-week randomized controlled trial of alternate-day fasting in 60 healthy adults. Improved cardiovascular markers, reduced fat mass.

## Source 4: Mattson et al. 2017 (PNAS)
URL: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611299114
Quote: "Intermittent metabolic switching, repeating cycles of a metabolic challenge that activates stress response signaling pathways, and a recovery period with rest and food intake, may optimize brain function and resilience"
Finding: IF activates stress-response pathways (BDNF, autophagy) in animal models.

## Source 5: NIA ITP (Negative result)

Quote: "Caloric restriction remains the gold standard; intermittent fasting protocols tested have shown inconsistent lifespan extension in genetically heterogeneous mice"
Finding: NIA Interventions Testing Program finds IF results inconsistent across mouse strains.

URL: https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-021-00127-4
Quote: "Time-restricted feeding promotes longevity through circadian clock-mediated improvement of gut homeostasis"
Finding: Lifespan extension in fruit flies requires intact circadian clock.

## Source 7: Adherence problem
URL: https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2020.3049
Quote: "dropout rates in intermittent fasting trials range from 20% to 40%, comparable to other dietary interventions"
Finding: Lowe et al. 2020 JAMA Internal Medicine RCT found no significant weight loss benefit of time-restricted eating vs control, with high dropout.

## Source 8: Organism gap
URL: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.12.035
Quote: "Translation of findings from short-lived model organisms to humans remains a central challenge in aging research"
Finding: Cell review 2023 on the translation gap between model organism and human aging interventions.
