**URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/

**Study type**: Systematic review of RCTs

**Key findings**:

- 6 RCTs met inclusion criteria, 281 total individuals
- "there was evidence that short term memory and intelligence/reasoning may be improved by creatine administration"
- "Regarding other cognitive domains, such as long-term memory, spatial memory, memory scanning, attention, executive function, response inhibition, word fluency, reaction time and mental fatigue, the results were conflicting"
- "Performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals"
- "Vegetarians responded better than meat-eaters in memory tasks but for other cognitive domains no differences were observed"
- "Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear"
- "Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals"
