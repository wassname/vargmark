# Creatine Brain Mechanism - Background

**Why creatine might affect cognition**:

Creatine is a key molecule in brain energy metabolism. The brain uses ~20% of total body energy despite being ~2% of body mass. Creatine acts as a temporal and spatial buffer for ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy currency.

The creatine-phosphocreatine system:
- Phosphocreatine donates its phosphate group to regenerate ATP from ADP
- This is especially important during bursts of high energy demand (e.g., complex cognitive tasks requiring speed of processing)
- The brain synthesizes some creatine endogenously but also takes it up from diet
- Vegetarians have lower baseline brain creatine because creatine is found primarily in meat and fish

**Key mechanism claims**:

1. Brain creatine levels can be increased by oral supplementation (shown via MRS - magnetic resonance spectroscopy)
2. Higher brain creatine = larger energy buffer = better performance on tasks requiring rapid ATP turnover
3. Vegetarians benefit more because they start from a lower baseline
4. Young healthy omnivores may already be at or near ceiling for brain creatine

**Limitations of the mechanism argument**:

- Brain uptake of creatine is limited by the blood-brain barrier transporter (SLC6A8)
- Supplementation may increase brain creatine by only ~5-10% (smaller than muscle increase of ~20%)
- The dose-response and time-course for brain effects are not well characterized
- Most MRS studies are small (n<20)
