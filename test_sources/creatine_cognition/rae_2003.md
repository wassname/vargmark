**URL**: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14561278/

**Study type**: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over RCT

**Design**: 45 young adult vegetarian subjects, 5 g/day creatine for 6 weeks

**Key findings**:

- "Creatine supplementation had a significant positive effect (p < 0.0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and intelligence (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices), both tasks that require speed of processing"
- "These findings underline a dynamic and significant role of brain energy capacity in influencing brain performance"
- Effect was specific to vegetarians (who have lower baseline brain creatine from dietary intake)
- Tasks sensitive to creatine were those requiring speed of processing
