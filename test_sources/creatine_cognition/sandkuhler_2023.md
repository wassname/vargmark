**Study type**: Randomized controlled trial (2023, more recent)

**Design**: Healthy adults (omnivores), creatine vs placebo, cognitive battery

**Key findings** (from abstract/public info):

- Tested omnivorous (not just vegetarian) population
- Found no significant effect on most cognitive domains in well-nourished young adults
- Consistent with Avgerinos 2018 finding that "performance on cognitive tasks stayed unchanged in young individuals"
- Suggests the cognitive benefit is population-dependent (vegetarians, elderly, sleep-deprived)
