ABSTRACT

Stable Diffusion revolutionised image creation from descriptive text. GPT-2, GPT-3(.5) and GPT-4
demonstrated astonishing performance across a variety of language tasks. ChatGPT introduced such
language models to the general public. It is now clear that large language models (LLMs) are here to
stay, and will bring about drastic change in the whole ecosystem of online text and images. In this
paper we consider what the future might hold. What will happen to GPT-{n} once LLMs contribute
much of the language found online? We find that use of model-generated content in training causes
irreversible defects in the resulting models, where tails of the original content distribution disappear.
We refer to this effect as model collapse1 and show that it can occur in Variational Autoencoders,
Gaussian Mixture Models and LLMs. We build theoretical intuition behind the phenomenon and
portray its ubiquity amongst all learned generative models. We demonstrate that it has to be taken
seriously if we are to sustain the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web.
Indeed, the value of data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly
valuable in the presence of content generated by LLMs in data crawled from the Internet.

Introduction

A lot of human communication happens online. Billions of emails are exchanged daily, along with billions of social-
media messages and millions of news articles. Almost all of this material was produced and curated only by humans in
the early years of the worldwide web, yet since the turn of the century search engines have come to determine what
people can find, and in the past decade smart text editors with spelling and grammar correction have helped tweak what
we produce. Now, text can not only be groomed and analysed efficiently; it can also be generated – by large language
models (LLMs). These models now (arguably) pass a weaker form of the Turing test in the sense that their output
cannot be reliably distinguished from text written by humans [Solaiman et al., 2019].

The development of LLMs is quite involved and requires masses of training data. Anecdotally, some powerful recent
models are trained using scrapes of much of the Internet, then further fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) [Griffith et al., 2013, OpenAI, 2023]. This further boosts the effective dataset size. Yet while
current LLMs [Devlin et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2022], including GPT-4, were
trained on predominantly human-generated text, this may change in the future. If most future models’ training data
is also scraped from the web, then they will inevitably come to train on data produced by their predecessors. In this
paper, we investigate what happens when text produced, e.g. by a version of GPT, forms most of the training dataset of
following models. What happens to GPT versions GPT-{n} as generation n increases?2

1The name is inspired by the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) literature on mode collapse, where GANs start producing
a limited set of outputs that all trick the discriminator. Model Collapse is a process whereby models eventually converge to a state
similar to that of a GAN Mode Collapse. The original version of this paper referred to this effect as ‘model dementia’, but we decided
to change this following feedback that it trivialised the medical notion of ‘dementia’ and could cause offence.

2This is not limited to text models; one can also consider what happens when music created by human composers and played by

human musicians trains models whose output trains other models.

Model Collapse

We discover that learning from data produced by other models causes model collapse – a degenerative process whereby,
over time, models forget the true underlying data distribution, even in the absence of a shift in the distribution over time.
We give examples of model collapse for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and
Large Language models (LLMs). We show that over time we start losing information about the true distribution, which
first starts with tails disappearing, and over the generations learned behaviours start converging to a point estimate with
very small variance. Furthermore, we show that this process is inevitable, even for cases with almost ideal conditions
for long-term learning i.e. no function estimation error.

Finally, we discuss the broader implications of model
collapse. We note that access to the original data dis-
tribution is crucial: in learning where the tails of the
underlying distribution matter, one needs access to real
human-produced data. In other words, the use of LLMs
at scale to publish content on the Internet will pollute
the collection of data to train them: data about human
interactions with LLMs will be increasingly valuable.

This paper is structured as follows. First, in Sections 3
and 4 we describe the reasons why model collapse hap-
pens. To best describe the intuition, we present a simple
example of a single-dimensional Gaussian where errors
due to sampling inevitably cause model collapse, which
are then extended to a multidimensional generative model
under some assumptions. Under both models, similar
lower bounds are derived on the risk, defined in terms of
the Wasserstein distance from the true distribution. Next,
we turn to GMMs and VAEs to show that additional
functional approximation errors further exacerbate model
collapse. Finally, we discuss the most commonly used
setting of fine-tuned language models, where we report
that only early signs of model collapse can be detected, if models are fine-tuned as opposed to trained from scratch.

Figure 1: Model Collapse refers to a degenerative learning
process where models start forgetting improbable events
over time, as the model becomes poisoned with its own
projection of reality.

In this paper we make the following contributions:

• We demonstrate the existence of a degenerative process in learning and name it model collapse;

• We demonstrate that model collapse exists in a variety of different model types and datasets;

• We show that, to avoid model collapse, access to genuine human-generated content is essential.

2 Related work

In this section we are going to cover two closest concepts to model collapse from existing literature: catastrophic
forgetting and data poisoning. Neither is able to explain the phenomenon of model collapse fully, as the setting is
fundamentally different, but they provide another perspective on the observed phenomenon.

2.1 Continual learning and catastrophic forgetting

Unlike traditional machine learning which seeks to learn from a static data distribution, continual learning attempts
to learn from a dynamic one, where data are supplied in a sequential fashion [Van de Ven and Tolias, 2019]. This
tends to be task-based, where data are provided with delineated task boundaries; e.g., classifying dogs from cats and
recognising handwritten digits. Our work is more similar to task-free continual learning [Aljundi et al., 2019] where
data distributions gradually change without the notion of separate tasks. Our work examines a particular scenario in
which the changed data distributions arise from the model itself, as a result of training in the previous iteration.

where each new generation is trained on data produced by the previous generation.

itinerant masons, supplemented by local parish labourers, according to Poyntz Wright. But other
authors reject this model, suggesting instead that leading architects designed the parish church towers
based on early examples of Perpendicular

Perpendicular Revival architecture is found in the 18th @-@ century Church of Our Lady of Guernsey,
which dates from the late 19th century. There are two types of perpendicular churches : those
Gen 1: architecture such as St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome or St. Peter’s Basilica in Buenos Aires. There is no
evidence that any of these buildings were built during the reign of Pope Innocent III, but it is possible
that they may have been built during the reign of his successor, Pope Innocent

Gen 7: architecture in England. In an interview with The New York Times, Wright said : " I don ’t think
there is anything wrong with me being able to do what I want to do. It just doesn ’t work for me. " He

A typical challenge in continual learning is that the model forgets previous samples when learning new information; this
is known as catastrophic forgetting [Kirkpatrick et al., 2017]. A typical way of preventing it is to use regularisations
(Memory Aware Synpass [Aljundi et al., 2018]) or just rely on data (e.g. Learning without Forgetting [Li and Hoiem,
2017]). This has an indirect connection to our work, yet differs since the data in the process of model collapse are
generated by different generations of models.

2.2 Data poisoning

Poisoning attacks are crafted and inserted during training in order to degrade the model’s performance when de-
ployed [Biggio et al., 2012]. Malicious data can be inserted into training data to induce unintended behaviors that can
be activated by special triggers [Gu et al., 2017]. The early literature on data poisoning focused mainly on supervised
learning, where classifiers are trained with labeled samples. But with the emergence of contrastive learning [Radford
et al., 2021] and LLMs [Brown et al., 2020], more recent models are trained with large-scale web crawls, making data
poisoning attacks more feasible on these untrustworthy web sources. Recent studies have demonstrated that web-scale
datasets can be poisoned by introducing malicious data into a small percentage of samples [Carlini and Terzis, 2021,
Carlini et al., 2023].

3 What is Model Collapse?

Definition 3.1 (Model Collapse). Model Collapse is a degenerative process affecting generations of learned generative
models, where generated data end up polluting the training set of the next generation of models; being trained on
polluted data, they then mis-perceive reality. We separate two special cases: early model collapse and late model
collapse. In early model collapse the model begins losing information about the tails of the distribution; in the late model
collapse model entangles different modes of the original distributions and converges to a distribution that carries little
resemblance to the original one, often with very small variance.

Note that this process is different from the process of catastrophic forgetting in that we are considering multiple models
over time, in which our models do not forget previously learned data, but rather start misinterpreting what they believe
to be real, by reinforcing their own beliefs.

This process occurs due to two specific sources of error compounding over generations and causing deviation from the
original model. Of these, one source of error plays a primary role, and in the absence of it, the process would not occur
beyond the first generation.

Figure 2: The high-level description of the feedback mechanism in the learning process. Here, data are assumed to be
human-curated and start off clean; then model 0 is trained and data are sampled from it; at step n, data are added to the
overall data from step n − 1, and this ensemble is used to train model n. Data obtained with Monte Carlo sampling
should ideally be statistically close to the original, provided fitting and sampling procedures are perfect. This process
depicts what happens in real life with the Internet – model-generated data become pervasive.

3.1 Causes of model collapse

There are two main causes for model collapse, one primary and one secondary, which we describe now. Further
mathematical intuition is provided in Section 4 to explain how these give rise to the errors observed, how different
sources can compound and how we can quantify the average model divergence rate.

• Statistical approximation error – this is the primary type of error, which arises due to the number of samples
being finite, and disappears as the number of samples tends to infinity. This occurs due to a non-zero probability
that information can get lost at every step of re-sampling. Figure 12 shows an example of an approximation
error. Here, a single-dimensional Gaussian is being approximated from a finite number of samples. Despite
using a very large number of points, the errors remain significant; with 107 samples we estimate the mean to
be 0.00024899 ± 1.89382984e−4, when the true value is 0.

• Functional approximation error – this is a secondary type of error, which stems from our function approx-
imators being insufficiently expressive (or sometimes too expressive outside of the original distribution
support [Nguyen et al., 2015]). It is well known that neural networks are universal functional approximators
in the limit, but in practice this is not always true. In particular, a neural network can introduce non-zero
likelihood outside of the support of the original distribution. A simple example of this error is if we were to try
fitting a mixture of two Gaussians with a single Gaussian. Even if we have perfect information about the data
distribution, model errors will be inevitable. It is important to also note that in the absence of statistical error,
functional approximation error only occurs at the first generation. Once the new distribution belongs to the
image of functional approximator, it remains exactly the same over the generations.

Each of the above can cause model collapse to get worse or better. Better approximation power can even be a double-
edged sword – better expressiveness may counteract statistical noise, resulting in a good approximation of the true
distribution, but it can equally compound this noise. More often then not, we get a cascading effect where combined
individual inaccuracy causes the overall error to grow. Overfitting the density model will cause the model to extrapolate
incorrectly and might give high density to low-density regions not covered in the training set support; these will then be
sampled with arbitrary frequency.

It is worth mentioning that modern computers also have a further computational error coming from the way floating
point numbers are represented. This error is not evenly spread across different floating point ranges, making it hard to
estimate the precise value of a given number. Such errors are smaller in magnitude and are fixable with more precise
hardware, making them less influential on model collapse.

4 Theoretical intuition

In this section we aim to provide a theoretical intuition for the phenomenon of model collapse. We argue that the process
of model collapse is universal among generative models that recursively train on data generated by previous generations.
We construct toy mathematical models, which prove to be simple enough to provide analytical expressions for quantities
of interest, but also portray the phenomenon of model collapse. We aim to quantify how different sources of error can
affect the overall end approximation of the original distribution. As discussed in Section 3.1, there are two main sources
we are interested in – statistical error and functional error. Since in the real world one rarely has infinite samples,
quantifying the functional approximation error alone is of little interest for discussion of model collapse. Therefore, we
will examine two simple cases: a discrete distribution in the absence of functional approximation error and a single
dimensional Gaussian case, which portrays how functional approximation error can compound with statistical error.

The overall stochastic process we are going to be considering (which we call Learning with Generational Data) is
the following. Assume that at generation i we have a dataset Di comprising of i.i.d. random variables X i
j, where
j ∈ {1, . . . , Mi} denotes the sample number at generation i and Mi ≥ 2. We will denote the distribution of X i as pi.
Here we assume that p0 denotes the original distribution, from which the data comes from. Going from generation i
to generation i + 1, we aim to estimate the distribution of samples in Di, with an approximation pθi+1. This step is
what we refer to as functional approximation Fθ : pi → pθi+1. We then resample the dataset Di+1 from the distribution
pi+1 = αipθi+1 + βipi + γip0, with non-negative parameters αi, βi, γi summing up to 1, i.e. they represent proportions
of data used from different generations. This corresponds to a mixing of data coming from the original distribution (γi),
data used by the previous generation (βi) and data generated by the new model (αi). We refer to this as the sampling
step. For the mathematical models to come, we consider αi = γi = 0 i.e. data only from a single step is used, while
numerical experiments are performed on more realistic choices of parameters.

4.1 Discrete distributions with exact approximation

In this subsection we consider a discrete probability distribution, which is represented by a histogram, e.g. as shown on
Figure 3. In what follows we consider the stochastic process in absence of functional approximation error, i.e. F(p) = p.
In this case, model collapse arises only due to statistical errors from the sampling step. At first, the tails (low probability
events) begin to disappear due to low probability of sampling them, and over time the distribution becomes a delta
function. Denoting the sample size as M , if we consider state i with probability q ≤ 1
M , the expected number of
samples with value i coming from those events will be less than 1, which means that in practice we will lose information
about them. This is portrayed on Figure 3, where infrequent events get cut off. Considering more generally some state
i with probability q, using standard conditional probability one can show that the probability of losing information
(i.e. sampling no data at some generation) is equal to 1 − q. But this in turn means that we must converge to a delta
function positioned at some state, and the probability of ending up at a certain state is equal to the probability of
sampling said state from the original distribution.

But how do we show directly that this process is going to turn our distribution into a delta function? By considering the
process as going from Xi → Fθ → pi+1 → Xi+1, we see that this forms a Markov Chain, as Xi+1 only depends on
Xi. Furthermore, if all the X i
j have the same value, then at the next generation the approximated distribution will be
exactly a delta function, and therefore all of X i+1
j will also have the same value. This implies that the Markov chain
contains at least one absorbing state, and therefore with probability 1 it will converge to one of the absorbing states.
This is a well-known fact, of which a proof is provided in Appendix A.1. For this chain, the only absorbing states are
those corresponding to delta functions. As a result, as we follow the progress of model collapse, we are guaranteed
to end up in a constant state, having lost all the information of the original distribution when the chain is absorbed.3
Based on the discussion above we see how both early and late stage model collapse must arise in the case of discrete
distributions with perfect functional approximation.

4.2 Single dimensional Gaussian

Following the discussion about discrete distributions, we now move on to considering how both functional approximation
error and sampling error can compound (or cancel out) the process of model collapse.
To demonstrate this, consider a single dimensional Gaussian X 0 ∼ N (µ, σ2). If we have full faith in the data we
observe, the functional approximation involves estimating sample mean and variance and fitting a single dimensional

3This argument also works in general due to floating point representations being discrete, making the Markov Chain over the
parameters of the model discrete. Thus as long as the model parameterisation allows for delta functions, we will get to it, as due to
sampling errors the only possible absorbing states are delta functions.

Figure 3: Shown in the middle is a histogram plot of samples from a Gaussian mixture with means (−4, 4) and variances
of 1. To the left of it is a similar distribution, but with ’fatter’ tails, and on the right the same histograms are shown, but
with low probability events being cut off due to finite resampling. Although distributions 1 and 2 are very different,
when resampled (only assuming the expected behaviour), the tails get cut off, leading to the same observed distribution.
In this case this is all states with probability less than 1/M , or equivalently, bins with log Count ≤ log M .

Equation (3), we see that even after the first approximation, the distribution of X i
j is no longer normal, it follows a
variance-gamma distribution [Fischer et al., 2023]. However, instead of writing the probability density function at each
generation, we can explicitly construct them in terms of independent random variables. In particular, it is well known
[Cochran, 1934] that µ1 and σ1 are independent, with µ1 ∼ N (µ, σ2

significantly.

This means that as n → ∞, the variance diverges linearly. This is the same scaling as for a single dimensional Gaussian
random walk. We can further see the similarities in numerical experiments shown on Figure 4 for a range of different
sample sizes, confirming these theoretical intuitions.
Even though the variance of X n
j diverges, it does not provide us with any information of what the corresponding
estimates of µn+1 and σ2
n+1 are, or how far they are from the original µ and σ. In particular, we may want to consider
what the distance would be between the true distribution and the approximated distribution at step n + 1. To measure
this we can consider the Wasserstein-2 distance between two normals:

(cid:0)N (µ, σ2), N (µn+1, σ2

n+1)(cid:1) = ∥µn+1 − µ∥2 + ∥σn+1 − σ∥2

This result allows us to interpret exactly what occurs in this formulation of model collapse. To be precise, due to errors
occurring from re-sampling the approximated distribution, each generation ends up corresponding to a new step in a
random walk of model parameters. The risk that occurs in this model ends up diverging for a constant sample size at
each generation. In order for the end distribution approximation to be accurate, and for the distance to be finite, the
sampling rate Mi needs to increase superlinearly, i.e. one needs to collect increasingly more samples over time, perhaps
quadratically. However, even in that case the expected distance after n steps remains non-zero and the only case in
which it does in fact end up being 0 is when sampling is infinite at each step. Overall, this only shows us how far on
average we go from the original distribution, but the process can only ’terminate’ if the estimated variance at a certain
generation becomes small enough, i.e. we effectively turn into a delta function.

Shown on Figures 5 and 6 are different runs of this process for different values of parameters of αi, βi, γi for different
sample sizes, which was investigated numerically to see whether they can be enough to overcome model collapse,
however even in those cases the changes are inevitable, although attenuated.

4.3 Noisy approximation model

With the simple example out of the way, we can now construct a lower bound on the distance of generation n distribution
from the original and show that without superlinear sampling it similarly diverges in the limit of large n. A nice property
of Wasserstein-2 distance is that Gaussians provide a universal lower bound for the Wasserstein distance [Gelbrich,
1990]. In particular, for κ and ν probability measures on a Euclidean N -dimensional space with µκ and µν means, Σκ
and Σν covariance matrices, we have that

κ

(cid:17)1/2(cid:19)

≥ ∥µκ − µν∥2

With this, instead of quantifying the distance exactly, we can instead lower bound it. The only limitation is that we are
going to have to specify a functional approximation model. In order to achieve a W2 bound, we will be required to
specify how the mean changes between generations. In the scenario where we only have access to the sample mean, we
would approximate the mean of the next generation distribution as Equation (1). However, as more information arrives,
or the model begins using it better, we may end up diverging from the sample mean. We would still require that the
model have good performance, i.e. on average the mean estimate is the same. We will also have to specify expected
behaviour of the model over the the variance calculation, which once again will be chosen such that it averages out.
Thus, we will adopt the following evolution over generations:

mean 0 and covariance IN and by the central limit theorem (CLT) we would have T i+1|µi, Σi
the lower bound will not rely on this. To arrive at a lower bound for the risk, similar to that of Equation (4), we are
going to have to make a few assumptions about the form of εi+1.

1. On average we can capture the mean to be the same as at the iteration prior:

E[εi+1|µi, Σi] = 0

2. Given all of X i

j, epsilon must be constant, i.e. it is a function of only the data:

In particular, it is dependent on µi and Σi only through the data.

εi+1 = εi+1

3. The extra noise is orthogonal to the sample mean in the sense of random variables. This is effectively assuming

that the noise does not contain any first moment information, i.e. we have:

Cov(εi+1, T i+1|µi, Σi) = 0
(9)
This may seem like a rather strong assumption, compared to the previous ones, however this property can
be shown to hold true when imposing CLT on T i+1 in the limit of large Mi (note here that Mi can only be
assumed to be large, and not infinite) and assuming that ε is strictly a function of moments higher than first.
Furthermore, a property of this type is necessary to actually provide any information, since prior to it there
would be no need to separate into an epsilon term and a sample mean term, since all could be absorbed into ε.

In Appendix A.2, we further provide an alternative to Assumption 3, wherein by bounding the size of noise we are able
to recover a similar bound, but only as an expansion in 1/Mi.
With all the assumptions in place, we now have the following bound:
(cid:3) ≥ E (cid:0)∥µi+1 − µ∥2(cid:1)

As a result, we have shown that the same superlinear scaling would be required to minimise the lower bound on model
collapse even in the case of more generic models of approximation, in which the mean at step i + 1 can be separated
orthogonally into the sample mean and ’extra’.

Overall, the message of this section can be summarised as follows:
When learning on generational data, due to finite sampling, we are only able to approximate the original distribution.
While on average we should recover the original distribution, the variance arising from this is non-zero. As a result,
over the generations, the average distance of n’th generation from the original grows and can become infinite in the
limit since errors compound over time.

5 Evaluation

5.1 Training from scratch with GMMs and VAEs

Gaussian Mixture Models. In this subsection we evaluate the performance of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
[Reynolds et al., 2009]. The underlying task here is that a given GMM tries to separate two artificially-generated
Gaussians. Figure 7 shows the progression of the GMM fitting process over time. The left-most plot shows the
original two Gaussians with the ground truth labels. The next plot shows the GMM fitted on the original data with
no cross-generational data used i.e. αi = γi = 0, where the error is minimal. Yet, within 50 iterations of re-sampling
we arrive to a point where the underlying distribution is mis-perceived. The performance worsens over time and by
iteration 2000 we arrive at a point estimate of the distribution with very little variance. The L2 distance between the
original GMM and its descendants is plotted in Figure 13.

very well as is shown on the left; yet even at generation 50 the perception of the underlying distribution completely
changes. At generation 2000 it converges to a state with very little variance. GMM is sampled a thousand times.

Figure 9: Random latent reconstructions from VAEs. No training data comes from the original distribution. Over the
generations, different modes of the original distribution get entangled and generated data starts looking unimodal.

Variational Autoencoders. In this subsection we turn to
Variational Autoencoders (VAE). As before, we train an
autoencoder on an original data source, which we later
sample. Here, we generate latents from a Gaussian dis-
tribution which are then used by the decoder to generate
data for the subsequent generation. Figure 9 on the left
shows an example of generated data using the setting
described by Kingma and Welling.

Having performed the process a number of times we ar-
rive at a representation that has very little resemblance of
the original classes learned from data. On the right, one
sees the generated images from generation 20, which ap-
pear to be a mix of all of the different digits. Interestingly,
the original encoder perceives the generated data from its
descendant with ever-growing confidence – the encoder
places such data closer and closer to the mean. Figure 8
shows the density of the latent representation of the orig-
inal model when presented with data generated by its
descendants. As with single-dimensional Gaussians, tails
disappear over time and all of the density shifts towards
the mean.

5.2 Language Models

Figure 8: Changing distribution of latents over the learning
process with generated data as perceived by the original
encoder. Just as with the Gaussian case described above,
the tails get washed away and the model arrives at the mean
representation of the underlying data.

By now it is clear that Model Collapse is universal across
different families of ML models. Yet if small models such as GMMs and VAEs are normally trained from scratch,
LLMs are different. They are so expensive to retrain from scratch that they are typically initialised with pre-trained

is shown with error bars. x-axis refers to the generation of the model – ‘Real’ refers to the ‘model 0’ trained on the

produced by model 1 etc. with all generated datasets equal in size. We find that models trained on generated data are
able to learn some of the original task, but with errors, as seen from the increase in perplexity.

models such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2018], RoBERTa [Liu et al., 2019], or GPT2 [Brown et al., 2020], which are trained
on large text corpora. They are then fine-tuned to various downstream tasks [Bommasani et al., 2022].

In this subsection we explore what happens with language models when they are sequentially fine-tuned with data
generated by other models4. We evaluate the most common setting of training a language model – a fine-tuning setting
where each of the training cycles starts from a pre-trained model with recent data. Data here comes from another
fine-tuned pre-trained model. Since training is restricted to produce models that are close to the original pre-trained
model and datapoints generated by the models will generally produce very small gradients, the expectation here may be
that the model should only change moderately after fine-tuning. We fine-tune the OPT-125m causal language model
made available by Meta through Huggingface [Zhang et al., 2022].

We fine-tune the model on the wikitext2 dataset. For data generation from the trained models we use a 5-way
beam-search. We block training sequences to be 64 tokens long; then for each token sequence in the training set, we
ask the model to predict the next 64 tokens. We go through all of the original training dataset and produce an artificial
dataset of the same size. Since we go though all of the original dataset and predict all of the blocks, if the model had
0.0 error it would produce the original wikitext2 dataset. Training for each of the generations starts with generation
from the original training data. Each experiment is ran 5 times and the results are shown as 5 separate runs. The
original model fine-tuned with real wikitext2 data gets 34 mean perplexity, from the zero-shot baseline of 115, i.e. it
successfully learns the task. Finally, to be as realistic as possible, we use the best performing model on the original task,
evaluated using the original wikitext2 validation set, as the base model for the subsequent generations, meaning in
practice observed Model Collapse can be even more pronounced.

Here we consider two different settings:

5 epochs, no original training data – Here, the model is trained for 5 epochs on the original dataset and no original
data. The overall original task performance is presented in Figure 10.(a). We find that training with generated data
allows one to adapt to the underlying task, losing some performance – from 20 to 28 perplexity points.

10 epochs, 10% of original training data preserved – Here the model is trained for 10 epochs on the original dataset
and every new generation of training, a random 10% of the original data points are sampled. The overall original

4One can easily replicate an experiment described in Section 5.1 with a language model to demonstrate model collapse. Given
that training a single moderately large model produces twice the American lifetime worth of CO2 [Strubell et al., 2019], we opted
to not run such an experiment and instead focus on a more realistic setting for a proof-of-concept. Note that just the language
experiments described in the paper took weeks to run.

Figure 11: Histograms of perplexities of each individual data training sequence produced by different generations as is
evaluated by the very first model trained with the real data. Over the generations models tend to produce samples that
the original model trained with real data is more likely to produce. At the same time, a much longer tail appears for later
generations – later generations start producing samples that would never be produced by the original model i.e. they
start misperceiving reality based on errors introduced by their ancestors. Same plots are shown in 3D in Figure 15.

task performance is presented in Figure 10.(b). We find that preservation of the original data allows for better model
fine-tuning and leads to only minor degradation of performance.

Both training regimes lead to degraded performance in our models, yet we do find that learning with generated data
is possible and models can successfully learn (some of) the underlying task. We now turn to consider the underlying
perception of probable events for each generation of our models.

Figure 11 shows histograms of individual datapoint perplexities generated by the models of different generations as
is evaluated by the first model developed with real wikitext2 training data. Here over the generations models tend
to produce more sequences that the original model would produce with the higher likelihood. The observed effect is
similar to that described for VAEs and GMMs in Section 5.1, where over the generations models started to produce
samples that would be produced with higher probabilities by the original model. At the same time, we discover that
generated data has much longer tails, suggesting that some of the data would never be produced by the original model –
these are the errors that accumulate because of the learning with generational data.

We find that data generated by language models in our experiments end up containing a large number of repeating
phrases. The repeating problem has been observed in nearly all text generation models [Keskar et al., 2019, Shumailov
et al., 2021] and to rule this out as the cause of Model Collapse, we further provide numerical experiments when models
are explicitly encouraged to produce non-repeating sequences with repeating penalty of 2.0. We find that this causes the
models to produce lower score continuations to avoid using repeats, which as a result causes the consequent models
to perform even worse. Figure 14 show model perplexities shift across the generations towards more probable token
sequences. In particular, enforcing this for the LLM experiments causes the perplexity to double, compared to the
original. Models remain as susceptible to Model Collapse, if not more.

The described process demonstrates that fine-tuning of language models does not curb the effects of Model Collapse and
models that are being fine-tuned are also vulnerable. We find that over the generations models tend to produce more
probable sequences from the original data and start introducing their own improbable sequences i.e. errors.

6 Discussion and Conclusion

We now discuss the implications of Model Collapse on the underlying learning dynamics of LLMs. Long-term
poisoning attacks on language models are not new. For example, we saw the creation of click, content, and troll farms –
a form of human ‘language models’, whose job is to misguide social networks and search algorithms. The negative
effect these poisoning attacks had on search results led to changes in search algorithms: e.g., Google downgraded

farmed articles5, putting more emphasis on content produced by trustworthy sources e.g. education domains, while
DuckDuckGo removed them altogether6.

What is different with the arrival of LLMs is the scale at which such poisoning can happen once it is automated.
Preserving the ability of LLMs to model low-probability events is essential to the fairness of their predictions:
such events are often relevant to marginalised groups. Low-probability events are also vital to understand complex
systems [Taleb, 2007].

Our evaluation suggests a “first mover advantage” when it comes to training models such as LLMs. In our work we
demonstrate that training on samples from another generative model can induce a distribution shift, which over time
causes Model Collapse. This in turn causes the model to mis-perceive the underlying learning task. To make sure that
learning is sustained over a long time period, one needs to make sure that access to the original data source is preserved
and that additional data not generated by LLMs remain available over time. The need to distinguish data generated
by LLMs from other data raises questions around the provenance of content that is crawled from the Internet: it is
unclear how content generated by LLMs can be tracked at scale. One option is community-wide coordination to ensure
that different parties involved in LLM creation and deployment share the information needed to resolve questions of
provenance. Otherwise, it may become increasingly difficult to train newer versions of LLMs without access to data
that was crawled from the Internet prior to the mass adoption of the technology, or direct access to data generated by
humans at scale.

Model Collapse

A Appendix

A.1 Absorbing Markov Chain

The subsection explains a well-known fact about absorbing Markov chains, that they converge to an absorbing state
with probability one. Assume that Xm form a Markov chain. In order to reason about this chain we need to consider
the transition probabilities. In general, these correspond to our functional approximation scheme. Due to the stochastic
nature of the Markov chain, we expect to have the variance go up and down. But as the variance decreases, the newly
sampled data, due to its finiteness, will be more concentrated, leading in the limit to a set of i.e. a delta functions. This
argument assumes that the approximation scheme is good and can converge to delta functions. If not, the errors in
approximation may prevent the propagation of errors in stochasticity.

As discussed in the previous section, we can model the process of repeated ‘sampling’ and ‘fitting’ as a Markov chain.
In this subsection, we explain how such a process can converge to a stationary state i.e. the absorbing state of a Markov
Chain. In this derivation we follow Allan Yashinski 7. Suppose we have an absorbing Markov Chain with r transient
states t1, . . . , tr and s absorbing states a1, . . . , as. The whole Markov chain has r + s states, ordered as follows:
t1, . . . , tr, a1, . . . , as. The transition matrix is then defined as

T =

(cid:21)

(cid:20)Q 0r×s
Is
R

,

(16)

where

• Q is an r × r matrix holds the probabilities of moving from a transient state to another transient state
• R is an s × r matrix which holds the probabilities of moving from a transient state to an absorbing state.
• 0r×s is the r × s matrix of all 0’s. There 0’s represent the probabilities of moving from an absorbing state to a

transient state (which is impossible by definition).

• Is holds the probabilities of transitioning between the absorbing states. As transition is impossible, this is just

the s × s identity matrix.

We are interested in limk→∞ T k(X0). For a given k, the matrix becomes

T k =

(cid:20)
Qk
R + RQ + · · · + RQk−1

(cid:21)

0r×s
Is

=

(cid:20)
Qk
R (cid:80)k−1
i=0 Qi

(cid:21)

.

0r×s
Is

(17)

Finally, for an absorbing Markov chain with T =

we have limk→∞ T k =

(cid:20)
0r×r
R(Ir − Q)−1

(cid:21)
.

0r×s
Is

(cid:20)Q 0r×s
Is
R

(cid:21)
,

Since in the limit the transition probabilities to transient states are zero, we end up converging to absorbing states and
staying there. In the case of discrete distributions, where we can perfectly approximate a zero-variance dataset (i.e. a
delta function), the absorbing states are delta functions centered at any non-zero probability point from the original
distribution. In practice, we would like to know the expected number of steps before being absorbed, which may be
large. But without knowing our fitting procedure it is impossible to calculate the matrix Q and therefore the average
length of time before collapse.

A.2 Alternative assumption for noisy approximations

This subsection will cover an alternative assumption, which may be more realistic in some settings, in contrast to
assumption 3 from Section 4.3, and this subsection mostly acts as an extension, rather than an alternative. In particular,
instead of imposing orthogonality, we can instead impose a certain size requirement on the noise term. This in turn
allows us to arrive to a similar result.

To be more precise, we will consider the same setting as in Section 4.3, but we will now replace Assumption 3 with
Assumption 3*:

expectation maximization algorithm.

Assumptions:

3*. The extra noise is going to be assumed to be bounded and of the order larger than the sample mean deviation.

To be precise we will have a constant K (not dependent on generation i), such that for all i:

∥εi+1∥ ≤

K
Mi

Now with the alternative assumption in place, we can follow the exact same calculations to arrive at
i T i+1(cid:17)

(cid:3) ≥ E (cid:0)∥µi − µ∥2(cid:1) +

where we used the Cauchy-Schwarz and Jensen inequalities. Note that this is far from optimal inequality, since instead
of using the expected value of the largest eigenvalue, we instead bounded it by Tr Σ. In particular, the per step bound is
then:

Without knowledge of the specific values of K, N or Tr Σ, the best we can do is consider what this means for the bound
as Mi becomes large. In particular, contribution from the last two terms will be of order at most 3/2. As a result we
recover a bound similar to all of the ones observed so far:

In particular, we find in the same way, that superlinear scaling would be required to minimise the lower bound on model
collapse even in the case of more generic models of approximation, in which the mean at step i + 1 can be separated
into the sample mean and an extra bounded term of order at most 1/Mi.

Figure 14: Histogram of perplexities of each individual data training sequence produced by different generations as is
evaluated by the very first model trained with the real data. Over the generations models tend to produce samples that
the original model (trained with real data) is more likely to produce. At the same time, a much longer tail appears for
later generations – later generations start producing samples that would never be produced by the original model i.e. they
start misperceiving reality based on errors introduced by their ancestors. Models here are explicitly forced to not repeat
sequences with a penalty of 2.0.
