# Evidence For

<Systematic Review Evidence>

(1) [SR Finding]: Avgerinos et al. 2018 systematically reviewed 6 RCTs
    (281 individuals) on creatine and cognition. #observation
    [Avgerinos et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/)
    > "Oral creatine administration may improve short-term memory and intelligence/reasoning of healthy individuals but its effect on other cognitive domains remains unclear"
    {reason: "systematic review of 6 RCTs but small total N=281", credence: 0.72}
(2) [Stressed Benefit]: The review found particular benefit for aging
    and stressed individuals. #observation
    [Avgerinos et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29704637/)
    > "Findings suggest potential benefit for aging and stressed individuals"
    {reason: "subgroup finding from same review, plausible but less direct data", credence: 0.60}
----
(3) [SR Supports]: Systematic review evidence supports creatine improving
    at least some cognitive domains.
    {reason: "direct implication of review but hedged language", inference: 0.70}

<Vegetarian RCT>

(1) [Veg Effect]: Rae et al. 2003 found significant cognitive effects in a
    double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with 45 vegetarians. #observation
    [Rae et al. 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14561278/)
    > "Creatine supplementation had a significant positive effect (p < 0.0001) on both working memory (backward digit span) and intelligence (Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices), both tasks that require speed of processing"
    {reason: "RCT crossover design p<0.0001, but small N=45 and vegetarians only", credence: 0.75}
(2) [Energy Buffer]: Brain creatine acts as a temporal ATP buffer and
    vegetarians have lower baseline levels from reduced dietary intake. #mechanism
    {reason: "well-established biochemistry explaining why depleted populations benefit more", credence: 0.85}
----
(3) [Depleted Benefit]: Creatine reliably improves cognition in populations
    with low baseline brain creatine.
    {reason: "strong effect plus plausible mechanism but may not generalize to omnivores", inference: 0.75}
  +> [Creatine Improves Cognition]

# Evidence Against

<Largest RCT Weak Effect>

(1) [Weak BDS]: Sandkuhler et al. 2023, the largest creatine-cognition RCT
    (n=123), found only borderline effects on working memory. #observation
    [Sandkuhler et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37968687/)
    > "The creatine effect bordered significance for BDS (p = 0.064) but not RAPM (p = 0.327)"
    {reason: "largest preregistered RCT to date with borderline primary outcome", credence: 0.85}
(2) [No Veg Advantage]: The same study found vegetarians did not benefit
    more than omnivores, contradicting Rae 2003. #observation
    [Sandkuhler et al. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37968687/)
    > "Vegetarians did not benefit more from creatine than omnivores"
    {reason: "contradicts Rae 2003 vegetarian advantage with larger sample", credence: 0.80}
----
(3) [Effect Uncertain]: The largest and most rigorous RCT fails to confirm
    a reliable cognitive benefit of creatine supplementation.
    {reason: "null on RAPM, borderline on BDS, but Bayesian analysis slightly favored effect", inference: 0.55}
