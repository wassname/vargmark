# Evidence For

<Longevity Pathways>

(1) [NEJM Metabolic Switch]: De Cabo & Mattson 2019 review evidence that
    fasting triggers a metabolic switch linked to increased longevity. #observation
    [De Cabo & Mattson 2019](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1905136)
    > "Evidence is accumulating that eating in a 6-hour period and fasting for 18 hours can trigger a metabolic switch from glucose-based to ketone-based energy, with increased stress resistance, increased longevity, and a decreased incidence of diseases"
    {credence: 0.78, reason: "NEJM review, high prestige, but summarizes mostly animal data"}
(2) [Aging Delay]: Longo & Panda 2016 argue fasting can delay aging
    through cellular maintenance pathways. #observation
    [Longo & Panda 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.06.001)
    > "Both intermittent and periodic fasting result in benefits ranging from the prevention to the enhanced treatment of diseases"
    {credence: 0.65, reason: "Cell Metabolism review, but hedged language ('potential')"}
(3) [Stress Response]: Mattson et al. 2018 describe intermittent metabolic
    switching as optimizing brain function and resilience. #observation
    [Mattson et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.156)
    > "intermittent metabolic switching, repeating cycles of a metabolic challenge that induces ketosis (fasting and/or exercise) followed by a recovery period (eating, resting and sleeping), may optimize brain function and resilience throughout the lifespan"
    {credence: 0.68, reason: "Nat Rev Neurosci paper, plausible mechanism but animal models only"}
----
(4) [Mechanisms Plausible]: Multiple biological pathways connect IF to
    longevity-related processes in animal models.
    {inference: 0.65, reason: "converging mechanisms but all from animals, not human lifespan data"}
  +> [IF Extends Lifespan]

<Human Biomarker Evidence>

(1) [ADF Trial]: Stekovic et al. 2019 RCT of alternate-day fasting
    in healthy adults found improved health markers with no adverse
    effects over 6 months. #observation
    [Stekovic et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2019.07.016)
    > "4 weeks of strict alternate day fasting (ADF) improved markers of general health in healthy, middle-aged humans while causing a 37% calorie reduction on average. No adverse effects occurred even after >6 months"
    {credence: 0.72, reason: "RCT in humans, but small sample and surrogate endpoints only"}
(2) [Biomarker-Lifespan Link]: Improved cardiovascular and metabolic
    markers predict longer lifespan. #assumption
    {credence: 0.45, reason: "surrogate endpoint assumption; biomarker-outcome links often fail in practice"}
----
(3) [Human Signal Exists]: Short-term human trials show IF improves
    biomarkers associated with longevity.
    {inference: 0.40, reason: "weak: small trial, surrogate endpoints, no actual lifespan measurement"}
  +> [IF Extends Lifespan]

# Evidence Against

<Weak Animal Evidence>

(1) [ITP Inconsistency]: The NIA Interventions Testing Program tests
    agents in genetically heterogeneous mice; IF has not shown consistent
    lifespan extension in ITP results. #assumption
    {credence: 0.75, reason: "ITP is the gold-standard multi-site lifespan testing program; IF not among its positive hits"}
(2) [Circadian Dependency]: Ulgherait et al. 2021 show iTRF lifespan extension
    in Drosophila requires both circadian regulation and autophagy. #observation
    [Ulgherait et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03934-0)
    > "iTRF-mediated lifespan extension required both circadian regulation and autophagy, a conserved longevity pathway"
    {credence: 0.80, reason: "Nature, Drosophila model limits generalizability but mechanism is conserved"}
(3) [Translation Challenge]: Translating model organism lifespan
    findings to humans is a well-established challenge in aging
    research. #assumption
    {credence: 0.92, reason: "widely accepted in gerontology; different metabolic rates, genetics, and lifespans"}
(4) [No Human Lifespan Trial]: No RCT has ever measured actual human
    lifespan as an endpoint for any IF protocol. #assumption
    {credence: 0.95, reason: "such a trial would take decades and cost billions; none exists or is planned"}
----
(5) [Insufficient Evidence]: The animal evidence is inconsistent, the
    translation gap is real, and no direct human lifespan data exists.
    {inference: 0.82, reason: "strongest evidence (ITP) is negative; no human endpoint data at all"}
